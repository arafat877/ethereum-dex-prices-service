An open source utility for the Ethereum community.

Find the best price for any asset on any Decentralized Exchange (DEX) at any time.

## Introduction

`ethereum-dex-prices-service` is a JavaScript library for fetching real time price data from Ethereum decentralized exchanges. This repository contains free, open-source tools that anyone can use.

- Quickly launch an HTTP server to serve DEX prices in your applications
- Execute price searches from the command line to find cheap prices and arbitrage opportunities
- Add DEX prices API support in your NodeJS and web projects by simply importing the library's modular classes

#### [Example Web App](https://dexindex.io)

## Quick Start

NPM
`npm install --save ethereum-dex-prices-service`  // --> this command doesn't works

Yarn
`yarn add ethereum-dex-prices-service`

In your project

```JavaScript
const { main } = require('ethereum-dex-prices-service')

async function getDexPrices() {
  const results = await main('DAI', 500, 'BUY')
  results.forEach(obj => {
    // do some stuff
  })
}
```

or just import individual DEX classes

```JavaScript
const { AirSwap } = require('ethereum-dex-prices-service')

async function getAirSwapPrice() {
  const result = await AirSwap.computePrice('DAI', 500, 'BUY', 0)
  console.log(result)
}
```

## Architecture

The service is composed of modular ES6 classes. Each decentralized exchange or "DEX" has its own class inside the `exchanges/` directory. Classic order book style DEX's inherit from the base `OrderBookExchange` class. Unique DEX's like AirSwap, Kyber, and Bancor use their own inidividual classes. Every class implements a method called `computePrice` to return price data in a generalized schema.

##### Example Data

###### Price data found

```
{
  "exchangeName": "Bancor",
  "totalPrice": 2.5494668914843825,
  "tokenAmount": 300,
  "tokenSymbol": "MKR",
  "avgPrice": 0.008498222971614608,
  "timestamp": 1548101818616,
  "error": null
}
```

###### No price data found

```
{
  "exchangeName": "Bancor",
  "totalPrice": null,
  "tokenAmount": 300,
  "tokenSymbol": "DAI",
  "avgPrice": null,
  "timestamp": 1548101818616,
  "error": "DAI is not available on Bancor"
}
```

The data can be served in many different ways. There are currently three supported outputs:

- A command line tool `entrypoints/cli.js`
- A web server `entrypoints/server.js`
- A [Serverless](https://serverless.com/framework/) `handler.js`

We would like to eventually add support for:

- An NPM module
- A standalone Electron app with a React UI

## Getting started

##### Pre-requirements

- [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) >= v8.0.0
- [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/en/) >= v1.0.0

To run the service and get price data, follow these instructions:

1. Clone this repository
2. Make sure you have [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/en/) installed.
3. Install dependencies

```sh
yarn install
```

#### Running the service as a command line tool

```sh
yarn search buy 500 DAI // --> this command doesn't works
```

```sh
yarn search sell 300 OMG // --> this command doesn't works
```

#### Running the service as a web server

```sh
yarn serve:express
```

You should then see:

```sh
"Dex price server running on port 1337!"
```

Now, make an HTTP request:

```sh
curl http://localhost:1337/sell\?symbol\=DAI\&amount\=500 // --> this command doesn't works
```

## Commands

- `yarn search <BUY/SELL> <AMOUNT> <SYMBOL>` - Run the command line tool
- `yarn serve:express` - Start the web server

- `yarn debug:cli <BUY/SELL> <AMOUNT> <SYMBOL>` - Run the command line tool in live debugger mode
- `yarn debug:server` - Start the web server in live debugger mode
- `yarn lint` - Lint the code
- `yarn prettier:check` - Check code style
- `yarn prettier:fix` - Fix code style

## Contributing

**Contributions are welcome and encouraged!**
Simply fork this repository or create a new branch and open a pull request against `master`.

Before doing so, make sure to check code quality with ESLint and Prettier. You can use the yarn [Commands](#commands) to accomplish this. You'll want to make sure your code passes `yarn lint` and `yarn prettier:check`.

When opening a PR, please provide a brief summary explaining the changes as well as some code examples to test the functionality. Also, please be prepared to edit your pull request based on comments and feedback.
